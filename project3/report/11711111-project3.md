I didn't implemented any bonus feature in this project. I did a simple optimization by reducing dummy labels.

## Main Program

The main program is inherited from the program of project 2.

Based on the program of project 1, I added the **translation functions** to translate different kinds of nodes in the grammar tree. My translation functions are almost the same as what provided in the document.

My representation of TAC is **char string**, quite simple and straightforward.

With the support of the translation functions, by post-order traversing the grammar tree from the root node, I can get the TAC.

## Optimization

### Reducing the dummy labels

With the very naïve translation schemes, it's frequently that dummy labels exists.

For example:

```TAC
...
WRITE t7
LABEL label6 :
LABEL label3 :
t8 := #0
...
```

The label <code>label6</code> and <code>label3</code> in line 3 and line S4 denote the same position of the code.

I wrote a python script <code>op.py</code> to reduce such dummy labels. This script read the TAC code and found dummy labels and last reduce them, with substituting the removed labels in the <code>GOTO</code> instructions.

This script is invoked after the main program finished, which is invoked by system call of Linux:

```c
execlp("python3", "python3", "op.py", TAC_path, NULL);
```

By testing, this optimization can make $\sum \#executed\ instructions$ lesser for some SPL programs.
